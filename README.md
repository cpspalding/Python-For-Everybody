# Python-For-Everybody
Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)
-Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization
Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)
-Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) 
-Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures
Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)
My own application for data retrieval and processing.
Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity
Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)
I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.
Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)
The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
I have all required software.
I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.
Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)
Professor - for grade
Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job
