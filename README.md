# Python-For-Everybody </br>
Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog) </br>
-Develop a basic understanding of Python and what Python is. </br>
-Learn how to program. </br>
-Understand fundamental programming concepts such as data structures.</br>
-Describe the basics of the Structured Query Language. </br>
-Create your own applications for data retrieval and processing. </br>
Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do) </br>
-Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) </br>
-Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures </br>
-Only using python and not other langues. </br>
-Task is completed when course is finished. </br>
Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test) </br>
-My own application for data retrieval and processing. </br>
-Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity to keep my work updated and ontime. </br>
-Utilize core programming tools such as functions and loops. </br> 
-Have a completed project by the end of the course that is ON TIME. </br>
Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system) </br>
-Not paying for the course so I won't be able to obtain the certificate. </br>
-I don't know a single thing about programming so I'm learning everything from the beginning. </br>
-I can only work on project with wifi available. </br>
Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof) </br>
-The courses will be available for the duration of the semester. </br>
-I have a laptop to use python. </br>
-I will learn python. </br>
-I can skip the Installing Python unit because it's installed. </br>
-Might need additional time to complete sections because no previous knowledge. </br>
Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations) </br>
-Professor - for grade </br>
-Parents - just wanting to make them proud. </br>
-Florida- I'm on a full scholarship so I have to pass my classes. </br>
-Myself- I got this, even though I don't' know anything about computers, YET. </br>
-Perspective Employers - the basic understanding of python may be beneficial when running my family business Spalding Carpet Cleaners. </br>

-Complete independent program (2 hours) </br>
# So far, I've used python for everybody as a review to reinforce material the professor has taught us in class. It jogs my memory over the weekend while I'm working on my exercises and integration project. It's quite simple material, so it better enables me to grasp the concepts I have a hard time understanding, like loops.
